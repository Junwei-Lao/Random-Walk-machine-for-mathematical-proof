# Project description:
## This is a random walk state machine being used for further mathmatical provement. The machine stops when the convex hull area of its path reaches half of the boundary area (in \area) or it went through half of the points inside the boundary (in \unique_points).

## The projects' names end with "multiple" means it runs multiple time to see the distribution of total steps the machine toked, while those **WITHOUT** the "multiple" means it is just showing how the machine walks within a certain shape (just for one time).
